Day 8 signed distance functions #genuary #genuary2023 #genuary8

I have never used sdf before.  It was a very different approach for drawing shapes to the canvas.

I haven't used shaders yet either.  They have seemed a conceptual jump too far. But after following

 Piter Pasma's explanation about Signed Distance Functions on Youtube. I finally starting to think that way

 This little sketch is just something that was produced as I was hacking at the code to try and understand

 what was happening.  I still have a long road ahead to really understand and use it. but it was a fun start.
